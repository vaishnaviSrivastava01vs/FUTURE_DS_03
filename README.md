The Event Feedback Analysis project aimed to evaluate attendee responses from a college-level event by analyzing both quantitative ratings and qualitative comments. The dataset included feedback from 500 students, capturing metrics such as event rating, speaker clarity, organization quality, content usefulness, and open-ended remarks.
Using Python in Google Colab, the project applied statistical summaries, sentiment analysis (via TextBlob), and data visualization (Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud) to extract actionable insights. A formal report was generated, highlighting satisfaction levels, major concerns, and specific recommendations for future event planning.

This project effectively combined data science, natural language processing, and report writing to deliver a clear, insight-driven evaluation for stakeholders.
